            Nightmare before Christmas</em>. He is known as the "Pumpkin King"
            of Halloween Town. Jack is a tall skeletal figure with a passion
            for creating the best Halloween celebrations. However, he gets 
            tired of the same old routine and decides to take over Christmas.
