            <dt>Background</dt>
                <dd>Jack Skellington has worked his way up to Pumpkin King 
                    through his love of Halloween and passion for creating wonderful 
                    celebrations.

            <dt>Family</dt>
                <dd>Jack doesn't have any "living" blood-related family but the residents of
                    Halloween Town love him like a father, brother and son. Additionally,
                    he has a dog named Zero that is as close to family as it gets.</dd>
            <dt>Early Influences</dt>
                <dd>It is very clear that Jack was influenced at a young age by
                    the enormous creativity surrounding Halloween as well as his
                    unending curiosity.
