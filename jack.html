        Challenges<br>
        Jack faced several challenges with the takeover of Christmas Town.
        First, he misinterprets the spirit of christmas which leads him to 
        recreate it in a very creepy way. Secondly, he faced resistance from 
        the Halloween Town residents, and additionally, Jack faced internal 
        conflict because he was failing to create the feeling of joy he felt 
        when he first discovered Christmas Town.<br>
