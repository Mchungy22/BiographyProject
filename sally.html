        Sally Skellington is a rag doll character from Disney's <em>The 
            Nightmare Before Christmas.</em> She is the Pumpkin Queen of 
            Halloween Town and has a romantic interest in Jack Skellington. 
            <br><br>Dr. Finkelstein, a mad scientist, created Sally to serve him. 
            Sally was kept locked away so Dr. Finkelstein could study her 
            and control her life. Sally is different from the other monsters 
            in Halloween Town because she was created by a resident. 
            <br><br>Sally is always trying to get away from Dr. Finkelstein because she
            seeks independence and has a strong desire for respect 
            and appreciation. She enjoys cooking, celebrating, and sewing.
