        Zero is Jack Skellington's loyal, ghostly dog in <em>Tim Burton's The 
        Nightmare before Christmas</em>. He primarily serves as a faithful 
        companion following Jack through his adventures, especially when he 
        becomes obsessed with Christmas and attempts to take over the holiday. 
        Zero shows concern for Jack's well-being and even tries to guide him 
        back to Halloween Town when they are lost in Christmas Town by actions 
        like like fetching a picture showing Jack in his usual Halloween role. 
        <br><br>
        Zero is a transparent, ghostly dog with a glowing pumpkin nose, which 
        parallels Rudolph's red nose. Zero is a constant, loyal presence by 
        Jack's side, providing companionship and occasionally acting as a 
        voice of reason when Jack becomes too consumed with Christmas.
