                <dd>As the Pumpkin King, Jack is renowned for orchestrating
                    Halloween Town's annual celebration. His creativity, leadership,
                    and dedication have set the standard for what Halloween should be, 
                    earning him the admiration and respect of everyone in town.

            <dt>Contributions</dt>
                <dd>Jack's major contribution is the discovery and attempted takeover 
                    of Christmas Town. The takeover didn't go very smoothly but it 
                    showcased Jack's ambition and creativity
                </dd>
            <dt>Challenges</dt>
                <dd>Jack faced several challenges with the takeover of Christmas Town.
                    First, he misinterprets the spirit of christmas which leads him to 
                    recreate it in a very creepy way. Secondly, he faced resistance from 
                    the Halloween Town residents, and additionally, Jack faced internal 
                    conflict because he was failing to create the feeling of joy he felt 
                    when he first discovered Christmas Town.
